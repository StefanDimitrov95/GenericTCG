# Trading Card Game

–ê noncommercial card game project, that is inspired by the mini-game Gwent in the Witcher 3. This project was created for academic course.

## Game rules
    Each player receives 10 random Gwent cards pulled from their decks. Players can discard two cards and redraw in the hope of receiving two superior cards. This is done once. 

    Players place a Unit Card on the Gwent board in the dedicated combat row. Each player may play one card per turn unless a special ability enables them to do otherwise. Players may also utilize Weather Cards from the Neutral Deck. 

    Each unit Card has Strength points that are added for each player's total. A player will win a round of Gwent when the player has more points than the other and both players no longer have cards to play or the other player passes their turn.
    Matches are set with 2 wins out of 3 rounds
